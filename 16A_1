//The Body Mass Index (BMI) is defined as ratio of the weight of a person (in kilograms) to the square of the height (in meters). Write a program that receives weight and height, calculates the BMI, and reports the BMI category as per the following table:
//BMI Category	BMI
//Starvation	<=15
//Anorexic	    15.1 to 17.5
//Underweight	17.6 to 18.5
//Ideal	        18.6 to 24.9
//Overweight	25 to 29.9
//Obese	        30 to 39.9
//Morbidly Obese >=40
